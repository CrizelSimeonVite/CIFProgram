    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>Just to make sure you deliver what's needed, here's a list of what I'm expecting from you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1. Demonstration of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and human-readable coding techniques</p></li>
        <li><p>2. A function that accepts two parameters: CarID of car to be moved and CarID of car to move in front of. This function does not have a return result but should run the necessary database processes to do the "move" procedure. IMPORTANT: number of rows that needs to be updated should be kept at bare minimum (the perfect answer will only need one row update)</p></li>
        <li><p>3. A function that accepts one parameter: ColorID. Returns an ordered list of the cars that match the color specified in the parameter</p></li>
        <li><p>4. Optional, but doing this correctly will give you preferred status: Submit a solution using Django, Laravel, CodeIgniter, or any modern MVC framework</p></li>
        <li><p>5. Optional too, but will also give you preferred status if properly executed: At least 90% of your source codes have functional test and unit test coverage.</p></li>

    </ul>
